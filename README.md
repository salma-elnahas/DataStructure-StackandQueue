This repository contains two data structure tasks using C++.
The first task simulates a printer queue system where print jobs from multiple computers are managed in their order of arrival,
with tie-breaking based on job duration. Print jobs are read from a file named Printer.txt and processed in a queue. 
The second task implements a browser history system using a stack to manage backward and forward navigation between visited web pages. 
URLs are stored from a file into a stack, and the program allows the user to move back and forth between pages just like real browser behavior.
